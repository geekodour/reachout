# ReachOut
An open sourced directory of interesting and experienced people in your field. (a website later)
It might be phycology, politics, computer science whatever.

For example:

From Aaron Swartz we can learn a lot of things

```
|-- His story
|-- Social Activism
|-- Programming/Tech
|-- His Blog
|-- Things he liked or shared to other
|-- Books he read
|-- His Twitter
```

Things that made him who he was.

Now, everyone is not Aaron Swartz but everyone has something to share and we can learn something from everyone.

So, point is we make a open source directory of interesting and people in their domain from who we can learn something from.


So, each person added to the directory will have few fields (This is being discussed in [issue#1](https://github.com/geekodour/reachout/issues/1))
```
- Name
- Main Role
- Other Hats
- Notable work
- Organization
- Location
- Twitter
- LinkedIn
- Website
- Notes
- Work Tags
```

### Is this not just LinkedIn?
Absolutely not, all the people here will be submitted by contributors and then verified by mods. Main goal of ReachOut is to let
learners use the resources provided by people in their field not just to show public information.
